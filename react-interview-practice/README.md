# React Interview Practice ⚛️

Master React patterns, hooks, and performance optimization for frontend interviews.

## 📋 Overview

This section covers essential React concepts and patterns tested in technical interviews. Focus on hooks, state management, and real-world React patterns that demonstrate senior-level understanding.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Custom Hooks**: Build reusable logic with custom hooks
- **Performance**: Optimization with memoization and lazy loading
- **State Management**: Context, reducers, and complex state patterns
- **Component Patterns**: HOCs, render props, compound components
- **React Internals**: Understanding reconciliation and virtual DOM

- `hard-05-react-reconciliation` - Understanding React internals
- `hard-06-custom-hook-library` - Building a hook library

## 🏃 Getting Started

1. **Start with custom hooks** - Build foundational understanding
2. **Create your solution** in `solutions/problem-name.js`
3. **Test your solution** with `node test.js problem-name`
4. **Focus on patterns** over complex implementation

## 💡 Key Interview Topics Covered

### React Hooks Mastery
- useState and useEffect patterns
- Custom hook design principles
- Hook dependency arrays
- Hook rules and limitations

### Performance Optimization
- When to use useMemo and useCallback
- React.memo for component memoization
- Profiling and measuring performance
- Bundle splitting strategies

### State Management Patterns
- Local vs global state decisions
- Context API best practices
- State normalization
- Immutable update patterns

### Component Architecture
- Composition vs inheritance
- Props vs render props vs hooks
- Component responsibility separation
- Reusable component design

## 🎓 Interview Tips

1. **Explain your choices** - Why useState vs useReducer?
2. **Show performance awareness** - When to optimize
3. **Demonstrate patterns** - Know multiple solution approaches
4. **Handle edge cases** - Consider loading, error, and empty states
5. **Think in React** - Declarative vs imperative approaches

## 📚 Related Concepts

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Closures, async/await, destructuring
- **Browser APIs**: Local storage, intersection observer, web workers
- **Testing**: React Testing Library, Jest, component testing
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for props and hooks

## 🔗 Integration with Other Sections

- Combine with **testing-practice** for component testing
- Use **typescript-api-practice** for data fetching patterns
- Apply **performance-optimization** principles in React context
