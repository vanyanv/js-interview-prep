## Success Tips

1. **Use the UMPIRE Method** on every single problem (Understand, Match, Plan, Implement, Review, Evaluate)
2. **Talk Out Loud** — practice explaining your thinking as if in an interview
3. **Don't Look at Solutions** for at least 20 minutes — struggle builds understanding
4. **Review Mistakes** — understand why wrong approaches failed, not just the right answer
5. **Pattern First** — before coding, identify which pattern applies and why
6. **Time Yourself** — build speed gradually, especially in Week 4
7. **Run `node test.js <problem-name>`** after every solution to verify correctness
