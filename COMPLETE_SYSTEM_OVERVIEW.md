## 💡 Success Tips

### **Daily Habits**
- **Consistency > Intensity** - 1-2 problems daily
- **Use UMPIRE method** for every problem
- **Track progress** in the mastery tracker
- **Review mistakes** and learn from them

### **Interview Preparation**
- **Practice explaining** solutions out loud
- **Time yourself** on problems
- **Focus on patterns** not memorization
- **Handle edge cases** automatically

### **When Stuck**
1. Re-read the problem carefully
2. Check hints in the problem file
3. Review the pattern guide
4. Try brute force first, then optimize
5. Draw examples and trace through code
