Problem: Sort List
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Linked List, Fast & Slow Pointers, Divide and Conquer
LeetCode: #148
Pattern: Fast & Slow Pointers (Find Middle for Merge Sort)

Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

Example 1:
  Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
  Output: [1,2,3,4]

Example 2:
  Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
  Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]

Example 3:
  Input: head = []
  Output: []

Example 4:
  Input: head = [1]
  Output: [1]

Constraints:
  - The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4]
  - -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n log n) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(log n) for recursion stack, O(1) for iterative version

Pattern Notes:
  - Use merge sort algorithm on linked list
  - Fast/slow pointers to find middle for divide step
  - Recursively sort left and right halves
  - Merge two sorted linked lists
  - This demonstrates fast/slow pointers in divide-and-conquer context
  - Bottom-up approach can achieve O(1) space

ListNode Definition:
  class ListNode {
    constructor(val, next) {
      this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
      this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
  }

Hints:
  1. Use merge sort algorithm adapted for linked lists
  2. Find middle using fast/slow pointers for divide step
  3. Split list into two halves at the middle
  4. Recursively sort both halves
  5. Merge the two sorted halves back together
