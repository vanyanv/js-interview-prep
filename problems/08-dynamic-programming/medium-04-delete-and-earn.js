Problem: Delete and Earn (LeetCode #740)
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Dynamic Programming
Pattern: 1D DP, House Robber Variant

You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get
by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete
every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.

Return the maximum number of points you can earn.

Example 1:
  Input: nums = [3,4,2]
  Output: 6
  Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
  - Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
  - Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
  You earn a total of 6 points.

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
  Output: 9
  Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
  - Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
  - Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
  - Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
  You earn a total of 9 points.

Example 3:
  Input: nums = [3,1]
  Output: 4
  Explanation: Delete 3 to earn 3 points, then delete 1 to earn 1 point.

Example 4:
  Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,4,5,5,5,6]
  Output: 18
  Explanation: Take all 1's (3 points), skip 2, take 4 (4 points), take all 5's (15 points), skip 6.

Constraints:
  - 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
  - 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

Time Complexity: O(n + max(nums)) where n is length of nums
Space Complexity: O(max(nums)) for the points array

Dynamic Programming Pattern Notes:
  - Transform the problem: group identical numbers and calculate total points for each value
  - This becomes a House Robber problem where adjacent values cannot both be taken
  - State: dp[i] represents maximum points achievable considering values 0 to i
  - Recurrence: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + points[i])
  - Base cases: dp[0] = points[0], dp[1] = max(points[0], points[1])
  - Key insight: if we take value i, we cannot take values i-1 or i+1

Hints:
  - First, count frequency of each number and calculate total points for each value
  - This transforms into: "select non-adjacent elements to maximize sum"
  - Same pattern as House Robber: for each value, decide to take it or skip it
  - If you take value i, you get all points for that value but cannot take i-1 or i+1
  - Build a points array where points[i] = count[i] * i
  - Apply House Robber DP on this points array
  - Space optimization possible since you only need last two values
