Problem: Climbing Stairs (LeetCode #70)
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Dynamic Programming
Pattern: 1D DP, Fibonacci Sequence

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

This is a classic dynamic programming problem that follows the Fibonacci sequence pattern.
At each step, you can reach it from either the previous step (n-1) or two steps back (n-2).

Example 1:
  Input: n = 2
  Output: 2
  Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
  1. 1 step + 1 step
  2. 2 steps

Example 2:
  Input: n = 3
  Output: 3
  Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
  1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
  2. 1 step + 2 steps
  3. 2 steps + 1 step

Example 3:
  Input: n = 4
  Output: 5
  Explanation: There are five ways to climb to the top.
  1. 1+1+1+1
  2. 1+1+2
  3. 1+2+1
  4. 2+1+1
  5. 2+2

Example 4:
  Input: n = 1
  Output: 1
  Explanation: Only one way: 1 step

Constraints:
  - 1 <= n <= 45
  - The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer

Time Complexity: O(n) for both memoization and tabulation
Space Complexity: O(n) for memoization (call stack + memo), O(1) for optimized tabulation

Dynamic Programming Pattern Notes:
  - State: dp[i] represents number of ways to reach step i
  - Recurrence: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
  - Base cases: dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1
  - This follows the Fibonacci sequence pattern
  - Can be optimized to O(1) space by only keeping track of last two values

Hints:
  - Think about how many ways you can reach step n
  - You can reach step n from step n-1 (by taking 1 step) or from step n-2 (by taking 2 steps)
  - This creates a recurrence relation: ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)
  - Start with base cases: ways(1) = 1, ways(2) = 2
  - Consider both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches
  - For space optimization, notice you only need the last two values
