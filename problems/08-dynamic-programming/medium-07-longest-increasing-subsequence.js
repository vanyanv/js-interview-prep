Problem: Longest Increasing Subsequence (LeetCode #300)
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Dynamic Programming
Pattern: 1D DP, Subsequence DP

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements
without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence
of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

Example 1:
  Input: nums = [10,9,1,5,3,7,101,18]
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,3,7,18], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [0,1,2,3], therefore the length is 4.

Example 3:
  Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
  Output: 1
  Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [7] (any single element), therefore the length is 1.

Example 4:
  Input: nums = [1,3,6,7,9,4,10,5,6]
  Output: 6
  Explanation: One longest increasing subsequence is [1,3,6,7,9,10], therefore the length is 6.

Example 5:
  Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
  Output: 1
  Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is any single element, therefore the length is 1.

Constraints:
  - 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
  - -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

Time Complexity: O(n^2) for DP solution, O(n log n) for binary search + patience sorting solution
Space Complexity: O(n) for both approaches

Dynamic Programming Pattern Notes:
  - State: dp[i] represents length of longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
  - Recurrence: dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1) for all j < i where nums[j] < nums[i]
  - Base case: dp[i] = 1 for all i (each element forms a subsequence of length 1)
  - Final answer: max(dp[i]) for all i
  - This is a classic subsequence DP problem
  - Alternative O(n log n) solution uses binary search with patience sorting concept

Hints:
  - Think about what information you need to track for each position
  - For each element, consider all previous elements that are smaller
  - The length at current position is 1 + maximum length ending at any valid previous position
  - Start with each position having length 1 (single element subsequence)
  - Consider both the O(n^2) DP approach and the O(n log n) binary search approach
  - For binary search approach, maintain an array of smallest tail elements for each length
