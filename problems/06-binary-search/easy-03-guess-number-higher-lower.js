Problem: Guess Number Higher or Lower
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Binary Search, Interactive
LeetCode: #374
Pattern: Binary Search with API

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
- -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
- 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
- 0: Your guess is correct (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

Example 1:
  Input: n = 10, pick = 6
  Output: 6
  Explanation: Game flows as follows:
    guess(5) -> 1 (pick is higher)
    guess(8) -> -1 (pick is lower)
    guess(6) -> 0 (correct!)

Example 2:
  Input: n = 1, pick = 1
  Output: 1
  Explanation: Only one number to guess

Example 3:
  Input: n = 2, pick = 1
  Output: 1
  Explanation: guess(1) -> 0 (correct!)

Example 4:
  Input: n = 100, pick = 75
  Output: 75
  Explanation: Binary search will find 75

Constraints:
  - 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
  - 1 <= pick <= n

Time Complexity: O(log n) where n is the upper bound
Space Complexity: O(1)

Pattern Notes:
  - Classic binary search with API calls
  - Use while (left <= right) for inclusive bounds
  - When guess(mid) returns -1, search left half: right = mid - 1
  - When guess(mid) returns 1, search right half: left = mid + 1
  - When guess(mid) returns 0, found the answer: return mid
  - Handle API responses correctly to avoid infinite loops
