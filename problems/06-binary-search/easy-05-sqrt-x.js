Problem: Sqrt(x)
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Binary Search, Math
LeetCode: #69
Pattern: Binary Search for Answer

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer.
The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

Example 1:
  Input: x = 4
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2

Example 2:
  Input: x = 8
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.828..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned

Example 3:
  Input: x = 0
  Output: 0
  Explanation: Square root of 0 is 0

Example 4:
  Input: x = 1
  Output: 1
  Explanation: Square root of 1 is 1

Example 5:
  Input: x = 16
  Output: 4
  Explanation: Perfect square, sqrt(16) = 4

Constraints:
  - 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Time Complexity: O(log x) where x is the input number
Space Complexity: O(1)

Pattern Notes:
  - Binary search on the answer space [0, x]
  - For large x, the answer is at most x/2 + 1, but using x as upper bound works
  - Use while (left <= right) for inclusive search
  - Check if mid * mid <= x to determine if mid is valid
  - Be careful with integer overflow: use mid <= x / mid instead of mid * mid <= x
  - Keep track of the last valid answer before going out of bounds
