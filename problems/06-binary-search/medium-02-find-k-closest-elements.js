Problem: Find K Closest Elements
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Binary Search, Array, Two Pointers, Sorting
LeetCode: #658
Pattern: Binary Search for Range

Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array.
The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:
- |a - x| < |b - x|, or
- |a - x| == |b - x| and a < b

Example 1:
  Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
  Output: [1,2,3,4]
  Explanation: The 4 closest elements to 3 are [1,2,3,4]

Example 2:
  Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
  Output: [1,2,3,4]
  Explanation: The 4 closest elements to -1 are [1,2,3,4]

Example 3:
  Input: arr = [1,1,1,10,10,10], k = 1, x = 9
  Output: [10]
  Explanation: 10 is closer to 9 than 1

Example 4:
  Input: arr = [0,0,1,2,3,3,4,7,7,8], k = 3, x = 5
  Output: [3,3,4]
  Explanation: The 3 closest elements to 5 are [3,3,4]

Example 5:
  Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1, x = 6
  Output: [5]
  Explanation: 5 is the closest element to 6

Constraints:
  - 1 <= k <= arr.length
  - 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
  - arr is sorted in ascending order
  - -10^4 <= arr[i], x <= 10^4

Time Complexity: O(log(n-k) + k) where n is the length of arr
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding output space

Pattern Notes:
  - Binary search to find the start of the k-element window
  - The result is a contiguous subarray of length k
  - Use binary search to find the optimal left boundary of this window
  - Compare distances: if arr[mid] is closer to x than arr[mid+k], move right
  - If arr[mid+k] is closer to x than arr[mid], move left
  - Final left pointer gives the start of the k closest elements
