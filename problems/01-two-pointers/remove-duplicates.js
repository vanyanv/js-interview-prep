Problem: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Arrays, Two Pointers
LeetCode: #26
Pattern: Two Pointers (Same Direction - Fast/Slow)

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the
duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by
modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
  Input: nums = [1,1,2]
  Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
  Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements
  of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
  Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]

Constraints:
  - 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
  - -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
  - nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Pattern Notes:
  - Use slow pointer for next unique position
  - Use fast pointer to scan through array
  - When fast finds new unique element, place at slow position
  - Return slow pointer + 1 (count of unique elements)
