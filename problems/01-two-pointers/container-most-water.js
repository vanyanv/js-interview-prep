Problem: Container With Most Water
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Array, Two Pointers, Greedy
LeetCode: #11
Pattern: Two Pointers (Opposite Direction)

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines
drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that can hold the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
  Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
  Output: 49
  Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
  In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
  Input: height = [1,1]
  Output: 1

Example 3:
  Input: height = [1,2,1]
  Output: 2

Constraints:
  - n == height.length
  - 2 <= n <= 10^5
  - 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Pattern Notes:
  - Use two pointers at opposite ends
  - Area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
  - Always move the pointer with smaller height
  - This is optimal because moving the taller line can't increase area with current shorter line
