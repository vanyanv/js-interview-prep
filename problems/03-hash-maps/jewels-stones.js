Problem: Jewels and Stones
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Strings, Hash Set
LeetCode: #771
Pattern: Set Membership Check

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels,
and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a
type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have
are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
  Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
  Output: 3

Example 2:
  Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
  Output: 0

Example 3:
  Input: jewels = "aAbBcC", stones = "aabbcc"
  Output: 6

Example 4:
  Input: jewels = "", stones = "abc"
  Output: 0

Constraints:
  - 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
  - jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
  - All the characters of jewels are unique.

Time Complexity: O(j + s) where j is jewels length, s is stones length
Space Complexity: O(j)

Hash Set Pattern Notes:
  - Convert jewels string to Set for O(1) lookup
  - Iterate through stones and count jewels
  - Set.has() is more efficient than string.includes()
  - Case sensitive comparison - 'a' != 'A'
  - Simple counting with set membership
