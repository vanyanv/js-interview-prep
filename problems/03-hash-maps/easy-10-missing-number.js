Problem: Missing Number
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Arrays, Math, Hash Set
LeetCode: #268
Pattern: Set Membership vs Expected Range

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n],
return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
  Input: nums = [3,0,1]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [0,1]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
  Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
  Output: 8
  Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints:
  - n == nums.length
  - 1 <= n <= 10^4
  - 0 <= nums[i] <= n
  - All the numbers of nums are unique.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) for Set solution, O(1) for math solution

Hash Set Pattern Notes:
  - Convert array to Set for O(1) lookup
  - Check each number from 0 to n for membership
  - Alternative solutions: sum formula, XOR, sorting
  - Set solution is straightforward and readable
  - Math solution: expected_sum - actual_sum
