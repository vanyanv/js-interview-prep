Problem: Single Number
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Arrays, Bit Manipulation, Hash Set
LeetCode: #136
Pattern: Set Toggle (Add/Remove)

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice
except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use
only constant extra space.

Example 1:
  Input: nums = [2,2,1]
  Output: 1

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
  Output: 4

Example 3:
  Input: nums = [1]
  Output: 1

Example 4:
  Input: nums = [2,1,2]
  Output: 1

Constraints:
  - 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
  - -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
  - Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) for Set solution, O(1) for XOR solution

Hash Set Pattern Notes:
  - Use Set to toggle elements (add if not present, remove if present)
  - After processing all elements, Set contains only the single number
  - Alternative: XOR all numbers (a ^ a = 0, 0 ^ a = a)
  - Set solution is more intuitive but uses O(n) space
  - XOR solution uses O(1) space but requires bit manipulation knowledge
