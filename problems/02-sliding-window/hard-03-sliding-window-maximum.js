Problem: Sliding Window Maximum
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Array, Queue, Sliding Window, Heap (Priority Queue), Monotonic Queue
LeetCode: #239
Pattern: Fixed Window Sliding Window with Deque

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

Example 1:
  Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
  Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
  Explanation:
  Window position                Max
  ---------------               -----
  [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
   1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
   1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
   1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
   1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
   1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [1], k = 1
  Output: [1]

Example 3:
  Input: nums = [1,-1], k = 1
  Output: [1,-1]

Example 4:
  Input: nums = [9,11], k = 2
  Output: [11]

Example 5:
  Input: nums = [4,-2], k = 2
  Output: [4]

Constraints:
  - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
  - -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
  - 1 <= k <= nums.length

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(k)

Pattern Notes:
  - Use monotonic deque (decreasing order) to efficiently track window maximum
  - Deque stores indices, not values, to easily check if elements are within current window
  - Maintain deque such that front always contains index of maximum element in current window
  - Remove indices from front if they're outside current window
  - Remove indices from back while their values are smaller than current element
  - Alternative approaches: segment tree, sparse table, but deque is most efficient
