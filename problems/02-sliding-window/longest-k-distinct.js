Problem: Longest Substring with Exactly K Distinct Characters
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Hash Table, String, Sliding Window
Pattern: Variable Window Sliding Window

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s that contains exactly k distinct characters.

Example 1:
  Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.

Example 2:
  Input: s = "aa", k = 1
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.

Example 3:
  Input: s = "abaccc", k = 3
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The substring is "bacc" with length 4.

Example 4:
  Input: s = "abcdef", k = 7
  Output: 0
  Explanation: There's no substring with 7 distinct characters.

Example 5:
  Input: s = "aaaaaaa", k = 3
  Output: 0
  Explanation: The string contains only 1 distinct character, can't have 3.

Example 6:
  Input: s = "abacadaeaf", k = 3
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The substring "adae" has exactly 3 distinct characters.

Constraints:
  - 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
  - 0 <= k <= 50
  - s consists of lowercase English letters

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(k)

Pattern Notes:
  - This is different from "at most k distinct" - we need exactly k
  - Use the helper function approach: exactly k = (at most k) - (at most k-1)
  - Alternative: Expand window until we have exactly k distinct characters
  - Once we have exactly k, try to extend as much as possible
  - When we get k+1 distinct characters, shrink until we have k again
