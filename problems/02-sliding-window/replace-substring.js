Problem: Replace the Substring for Balanced String
Difficulty: Medium
Category: String, Sliding Window
LeetCode: #1234
Pattern: Variable Window Sliding Window

You are given a string s of length n containing only four kinds of characters: 'Q', 'W', 'E', and 'R'.

A string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears n/4 times where n is the length of the string.

Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make s balanced.

If s is already balanced, return 0.

Example 1:
  Input: s = "QWER"
  Output: 0
  Explanation: s is already balanced.

Example 2:
  Input: s = "QQWE"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "QRWE" (or "RWQE" or any other combination) will be balanced.

Example 3:
  Input: s = "QQQQQWWWRRRREEEEE"
  Output: 4
  Explanation: We can replace the last 4 characters to make s = "QQQQQWWWRRRRWWWW" which is balanced.

Example 4:
  Input: s = "WWEQERQWQWWRWWERQWEQ"
  Output: 4

Constraints:
  - n == s.length
  - 4 <= n <= 10^5
  - s.length is a multiple of 4
  - s contains only 'Q', 'W', 'E', and 'R'

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Pattern Notes:
  - First count frequency of each character
  - Find which characters appear more than n/4 times (excess characters)
  - Find minimum substring that contains all excess characters
  - Use sliding window to find minimum substring that contains enough excess characters
  - The substring we find can be replaced to balance the string
